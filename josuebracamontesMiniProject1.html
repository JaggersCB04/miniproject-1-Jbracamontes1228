 <p>My favorite class is my 2<sup>nd</sup> hour. It's my favorite because I get to draw and that is what I like to do. Also it's becuase Ms. Wons is very chill. Next I like it because we don't do alot there. Furthermore I am also able to talk when I want. Finally Ms. Wons lets us sit anywhere we want to sit.
